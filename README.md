# Feedback Project

This app has an Express backend with a frontend built in React.

# Spinning it up

The easiest way to demo this is to run a `docker-compose up` from the root directory. The backend also has its own `docker-compose.yaml` that can be used to spin up the backend with a MongoDB instance. From there, you can develop against the frontend. I'm not exactly sure why, but the frontend takes a long time before it's ready.
